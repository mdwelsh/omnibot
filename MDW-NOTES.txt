Branch mdw/aijsx

[6 Aug 2024]

Two goals here:

* Reimplement Omnibot using AI.JSX rather than calling into a Fixie Agent
* Deploy to Vercel instead of Netlify (for consistency)

The Vercel change is easier -- we would need to modify the app to use Next.js, and put the Netlify
Function (which calls into a Fixie Agent) behind an "api/" endpoint. This is probably fairly simple.

For reimplementing the API backend using AI.JSX: Two options.
  1. Use the FixieCorpus stuff and have it use the Fixie corpus ID from the Omnibot Fixie agent. (Definitely easier.)
  2. Use Pinecone directly and reimplement the indexing, KNN, etc. stuff in AI.JSX (more fun, more work.)
